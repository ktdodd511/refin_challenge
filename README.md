## To run this file in the terminal, type the following:
` gem install 'soda-ruby'`

`ruby open_food_trucks.rb`


## If this were a full-stack application, a framework such as Rails or Sinatra could be used to handle the data being displayed on the front-end. That way buttons could be used to capture user input instead of the user typing into the terminal. I'd probably use Sinatra, as this application isn't very complex, and it's hitting a simple API.
